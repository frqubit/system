These are the setup scripts for my Debian machine. They install things like Spotify and
Discord, my graphics tablet driver, Firefox updates, and other tools that make using
Debian easier for me.

They are here for my purposes, but if they are helpful for you, feel free to use anything
here. I will be updating this as software upgrades get released.
